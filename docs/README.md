# tinyserve docs

This folder will hold operational notes and examples for tinyserve. For now it includes the LaunchAgent plist used to run the daemon as a user service on macOS. Add deployment/runbook notes here as the stack grows (compose templates, backup/restore, Cloudflare tunnel setup, etc.).
